# Data Requirements Document

## 1. Data Sources and Collection Methods

The Claude MCP Servers Configuration toolkit does not directly collect or generate data. However, it manages MCP servers that do. The primary data source managed by this toolkit is the **Memory Bank MCP Server**, which stores its data in a local JSON file.

*   **Data Source**: User interactions with the Memory Bank MCP server.
*   **Collection Method**: The Memory Bank server writes to `data/memory-bank/memory.json`.

## 2. Data Models and Schema Design

The data model for the Memory Bank is a simple key-value store, where the keys are memory IDs and the values are the memory content. The data is stored in a JSON file with the following schema:

```json
{
  "<memory_id>": {
    "content": "<memory_content>",
    "timestamp": "<iso_8601_timestamp>"
  }
}
```

## 3. Data Quality Requirements

Data quality is the responsibility of the user and the MCP servers themselves. The toolkit does not perform any data validation or cleansing.

## 4. Data Governance and Security

*   **Data Ownership**: The user owns all data generated by the MCP servers.
*   **Access Control**: The data is stored in the local `data/` directory, and access is controlled by the user's file system permissions.
*   **Security**: The toolkit does not handle any sensitive data directly. It is the user's responsibility to ensure that no sensitive data is stored in the Memory Bank.

## 5. Data Migration and Integration Plans

This is not applicable, as the toolkit does not have its own data to migrate.

## 6. Backup and Recovery Procedures

It is recommended that users include the `data/` directory in their regular backup procedures. To recover the data, the user can simply restore the `data/` directory from a backup.

*   **RTO (Recovery Time Objective)**: The time it takes to restore the `data/` directory from a backup.
*   **RPO (Recovery Point Objective)**: The time since the last backup of the `data/` directory.

## 7. Data Retention and Archiving Policies

Data retention and archiving are managed by the user. The user can manually delete or archive the contents of the `data/` directory as needed.
