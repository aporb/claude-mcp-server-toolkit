# Technical Requirements Document (TRD)

## 1. System Architecture and Design

[Describe the overall system architecture, including major components, their interactions, and deployment considerations. Provide a high-level overview of how the system will be structured.]

```mermaid
C4Context
    title System Context Diagram for [Product Name]
    Person(user, "[User Role]", "[User's Description]")
    System(system, "[Product Name]", "[Product's High-Level Description]")

    Rel(user, system, "Uses")
```

## 2. Technology Stack and Platform Requirements

[Specify the programming languages, frameworks, databases, operating systems, and other technologies that will be used. Justify the choices and outline any specific version requirements.]

## 3. Integration Specifications

[Detail how the system will integrate with other internal or external systems. Include API specifications, data exchange formats, and communication protocols.]

```mermaid

    participant SystemA as Existing System A
    participant NewSystem as New Product System
    participant SystemB as External System B

    NewSystem->>SystemA: Request Data ([Data Type])
    SystemA-->>NewSystem: Provide Data ([Data Type])
    NewSystem->>SystemB: Send Notification ([Event Type])
    SystemB-->>NewSystem: Acknowledge Notification
```

## 4. Data Architecture and Models

[Describe the high-level data architecture, including data storage mechanisms, data flow, and data processing. Reference the detailed data models in `07-data-requirements.md`.]

## 5. Security and Compliance Requirements

[Outline the security measures to be implemented (e.g., authentication, authorization, encryption, access control). List all relevant compliance standards (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, industry-specific regulations) that the system must adhere to.]

## 6. Performance and Scalability Requirements

[Define specific performance metrics (e.g., response times, throughput, latency) and scalability goals (e.g., number of concurrent users, data volume growth). Describe how the system will handle increasing loads.]

## 7. Development and Deployment Standards

[Specify coding standards, version control practices, testing methodologies, and deployment procedures. Outline the CI/CD pipeline and environment configurations.]
