# Technical Design Document

## 1. System Architecture Diagrams

[Provide detailed diagrams illustrating the system's architecture. Describe each component, its responsibilities, and how components interact. Include logical, physical, and deployment views as appropriate.]

### 1.1. Logical Architecture

```mermaid
C4Container
    title Container Diagram for [Product Name]
    Person(user, "[User Role]", "[User's Description]")
    System(external_system, "External System", "[Description of External System]")

    Container(web_app, "Web Application", "[Technology Stack]", "Provides user interface and handles requests.")
    Container(api_service, "API Service", "[Technology Stack]", "Exposes RESTful APIs for data access and business logic.")
    Container(database, "Database", "[Database Technology]", "Stores all persistent data.")

    Rel(user, web_app, "Uses")
    Rel(web_app, api_service, "Makes API calls")
    Rel(api_service, database, "Reads from and writes to")
    Rel(api_service, external_system, "Integrates with", "HTTPS/API")
```

### 1.2. Deployment Architecture

```mermaid
C4Deployment
    title Deployment Diagram for [Product Name]
    DeploymentNode(web_server, "Web Server", "[Server Type]") {
        Container(web_app, "Web Application", "[Technology Stack]")
    }
    DeploymentNode(app_server, "Application Server", "[Server Type]") {
        Container(api_service, "API Service", "[Technology Stack]")
    }
    DeploymentNode(db_server, "Database Server", "[Server Type]") {
        Container(database, "Database", "[Database Technology]")
    }

    Rel(web_server, app_server, "Communicates with", "HTTPS")
    Rel(app_server, db_server, "Connects to", "Database Protocol")
```

## 2. Database Design and ERD Descriptions

[Provide detailed database schema designs. Describe tables, columns, data types, relationships, and indexing strategies. Reference the ERD from `07-data-requirements.md` and provide more granular details here.]

```mermaid
erDiagram
    CUSTOMER ||--o{ ORDER : places
    CUSTOMER { 
        string customer_id PK
        string name
        string email
    }
    ORDER {
        string order_id PK
        string customer_id FK
        date order_date
        float total_amount
    }
```

## 3. API Specifications and Documentation

[Document all internal and external APIs. For each API, include endpoints, methods, request/response formats, authentication mechanisms, and error codes. Consider using OpenAPI/Swagger specifications.]

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant API_Gateway
    participant AuthService
    participant ProductService

    Client->>API_Gateway: GET /products/{id}
    API_Gateway->>AuthService: Validate Token
    AuthService-->>API_Gateway: Token Valid
    API_Gateway->>ProductService: Get Product Details
    ProductService-->>API_Gateway: Product Data
    API_Gateway-->>Client: Product Details (JSON)
```

## 4. Security Implementation Details

[Detail the implementation of security features, including authentication flows, authorization rules, data encryption at rest and in transit, vulnerability management, and security auditing mechanisms.]

## 5. Error Handling and Logging

[Describe the strategy for error handling across the system, including error types, custom error messages, and how errors are propagated. Detail the logging strategy, including log levels, log formats, storage, and monitoring.]

## 6. Performance Optimization Strategies

[Outline specific techniques and approaches to ensure the system meets performance requirements, such as caching strategies, database query optimizations, load balancing, and code efficiency improvements.]

## 7. Code Standards and Conventions

[Specify the coding guidelines, naming conventions, and best practices that development teams must follow to ensure code quality, maintainability, and consistency.]
